# Massive Platform
{: .fs-9 }

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT (25 August 2022): Massive Platform is no longer being maintained. We started the project in 2014 and built some amazing communities with it, creating hundreds of thousands of real-world, in-person connections at events all over the world. In 2021 we rebuilt [Travel Massive](https://travelmassive.com) with a new, modern web framework and chose [Phoenix Liveview](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). Thanks to everyone who supported Massive Platform over the years. ~ Ian (founder, Travel Massive & Massive Platform).

Massive Platform is a community platform to build and grow event-driven, chapter-based communities.
